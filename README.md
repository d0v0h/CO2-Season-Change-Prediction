# ðŸŽ“ Introduction to Big Data - Term Project

**Topic**: Predicting Seasonal Length Changes Based on COâ‚‚ Concentration

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between COâ‚‚ concentration and seasonal length changes in South Korea and uses that relationship to predict future seasonal lengths. The experiment was conducted in the following steps:

1. **COâ‚‚ Emissions Forecasting**  
   `COâ‚‚_emissions(2024â€“2050) = LinearRegression(COâ‚‚_emissions(1959â€“2023))`

2. **COâ‚‚ Concentration Forecasting**  
   `COâ‚‚_ppm(2024â€“2050) = SARIMAX(COâ‚‚_emissions(2024â€“2050))`

3. **Future Seasonal Length Prediction**  
   `Season(2024â€“2050) = SARIMAX(COâ‚‚_ppm(2024â€“2050))`

## 2. Seasonal Length Data Construction

- Seasonal lengths were defined based on meteorological criteria:
  - **Summer**: The first day when the 9-day moving average of daily temperature exceeds 20Â°C and does not drop below again
  - Similarly:
    - **Spring**: Exceeds 5Â°C
    - **Autumn**: Drops below 20Â°C
    - **Winter**: Drops below 5Â°C

## 3. Correlation Between COâ‚‚ and Seasonal Length

- **Spring & Summer**: Positive correlation with COâ‚‚ concentration  
- **Autumn & Winter**: Negative correlation with COâ‚‚ concentration

2. **Seasonal length prediction** using the predicted COâ‚‚ as an exogenous variable in the SARIMAX model

## 5. Carbon Neutrality Scenario Modeling

Based on COâ‚‚ emissions data from 23 countries, we created three scenarios:

1. **Carbon Neutral Achieved**: COâ‚‚ emissions reach 0 by 2050 (linear interpolation)
2. **Carbon Neutral Not Achieved**: Emissions predicted using linear regression

### Scenario 1: Carbon Neutral Achieved (16 Countries)

### Scenario 2: Carbon Neutral Not Achieved

### Scenario 3: Global Carbon Neutrality Achieved

## 8. Results & Insights

- **Carbon neutrality** tends to lead to a **recovery of seasonal balance**
- In **Scenario 3**, spring and summer lengths significantly decrease, while autumn shows recovery

---

## 9. Conclusion

- **Global warming** is a **shared challenge** requiring worldwide collaboration
- Without the participation of major COâ‚‚ emitters, carbon neutrality policies will have limited effectiveness
- Broader global cooperation can lead to seasonal recovery and real progress in combating climate change
